# Employee Wage

## Use Case 1 - Employee Present or Absent
### Date - 04-12-2024

The `checkAttendence` function uses the `Math.random()` function to generate a random attendence value between 0 and 1. The function then checks whether the attendence value is greater than 0, which corresponds to a 50% chance of the employee being present or absent.

## Use Case 2 - Daily Wage based on Work type
### Date - 04-12-2024

The `calculateWage` function uses the `Math.random()` function to generate a random number to determine whether the employee is working Part-Time, Full-Time or No-Time.Based on this, the function calculates the employee's salary. The work hours are fixed: Part-Time = 4 hours, Full-Time = 8 hours, and No-Time = 0 hours. The wage is then calculated based on the number of hours worked, with an hourly rate of $20.

## Use Case 3 - Refectored the code And Made it Minimal
### Date - 04-12-2024

The code has been refactored to simplify attendance and wage calculation. The `checkAttendance` function determines if the employee is present based on a random value. The `totalhour` function generates random work hours: 0 for absent, 4 for Part-Time, and 8 for Full-Time. The `calculateWage` function calculates the salary based on hours worked at a rate of $20 per hour.

## Use Case 4 - Employee Wages for a month 
### Date - 04-12-2024

The `monthlyWage` function calculates the total salary and hours worked by an employee over 20 workdays in a month. It calls the `calculateWage` function to get the daily hours worked and salary, and then aggregates the data. It tracks the total number of days worked, total hours, and total salary.

## Use Case 5 - Employee Wages for a month 
### Date - 04-12-2024

The `monthlyusingwhile` function calculates the total salary and hours worked by an employee over a month (up to 20 workdays or 160 hours). It tracks the number of days worked, total hours, and total salary earned.

### Key Differences from the Original Function:
- The function will stop calculating when either 20 days or 160 hours are reached.
- It ensures that the total hours worked in the month do not exceed 160 hours.
- The total salary is calculated based on daily wages returned by the `calculateWage()` function.

## Use Case 6 - Employee Wages for a Year
### Date - 05-12-2024

The `yearlySalary` Function calculates and store the total salary, worked hours and how many days the Employee worked for month by month.

## Use Case 7 - Employee Wages for a Year
### Date - 05-12-2024

The `addEmployee` Function calculates and store the total salary, worked hours and Name By using a array named data.

## Use Case 8 - Get data Of a Month
### Date - 05-12-2024

The `find` functions first takes the name of the employee as a input from the user and then it shows all the details of the employee stored in the array.

## Use Case 9 - Get data Of a Month (Solution For Duplicate Name)
### Date - 06-12-2024
The `findofthesamename` functions first check the multiple users data by a boolean variable and then fetch the employee data according user input and for that the function is using `Array.filter()` method and returns the data according to input.
